# FooBar
Foobar is a semi-secret hiring challenge Google put out there to find talented developers via somewhat unconventional yet fitting means. Foobar is a series of five levels of algorithmic questions of ever-increasing difficulty and allotted time to solve these questions.

## Motivation
On my frustration playing with a serial communication library using Perl, I decided to test my luck with Python. However, like in any other good research, I stumble on just another sidetrack sponsored by google. This time with the name of “Foobar challenge”, on my confusion decided to go for it.

## Challenges:
It was an addictive challenge/game, I played one after the other in whatever spare time I had. I remember finishing extremely tired, and with my brain fried.<br/>
Very difficult challenges, no retries available. You can submit only once.

## What did you learn:
Python<br/>
Sidetracks are sometimes fun and highly rewarded

## Note:
* Considering that I did not expect passing the first level, and  that I was a bit sad not completing all 5 levels. I felt proud reaching level 4 on my new acquired language
* Don’t tell anyone, it’s a secret!!

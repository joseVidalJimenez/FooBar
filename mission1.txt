Python
======
Your code will run inside a Python 2.7.13 sandbox. All tests will be run by calling the solution() function.

Standard libraries are supported except for bz2, crypt, fcntl, mmap, pwd, pyexpat, select, signal, termios, thread, time, unicodedata, zipimport, zlib.

Input/output operations are not allowed.

Your solution must be under 32000 characters in length including new lines and and other non-printing characters.




------
The special printer which can print the bumps onto the signs expects the dots in the following order:
1 4
2 5
3 6

So given the plain text word ""code"", you get the Braille dots:

11 10 11 10
00 01 01 01
00 10 00 00

where 1 represents a bump and 0 represents no bump. 
Put together, ""code"" becomes the output string 
""100100101010100110100010"".



Write a function solution(plaintext) 
takes a string parameter and returns a string of 1's and 0's representing the bumps and absence of bumps in the input string. 
Your function should be able to encode:
	the 26 lowercase letters
	handle capital letters by adding a Braille capitalization mark before that character
	use a blank character (000000) for spaces
All signs on the space station are less than fifty characters long and use only letters and spaces.
